# Development Decisions

Decided to go with https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter

Its an npm package that generates you a boiler plate typescript library that includes features such as:-

- prettier
- eslint
- testing framework
- ability to build and publish documentation

Was generated by running

`npx typescript-starter`

from the command line and filling in some basic options

## Tasks to implement

- [x] get to a point where I can TDD the ioc container
- [x] get the basic behaviour working (e.g. register and resolve)
- [ ] clean up remainants of boiler plate that aren't required (e.g. number.spec.ts)

- checks
- [x] Ensure the prettier rules work automatically and we get good linting
- [x] Ensure the tests are easily runable
- [x] ensure its easy to debug the unit tests
- [ ] Ensure the docs are good and have some examples about how to use it
- [ ] Check the readme is good

## Stretch goals

> See if we can get another app to consume this library

## Where would I extend this

### Functionaly

- option for singleton on transient creation
- consider a static or singleton option, so the container doesn't have to be passed where needed.

### Generically

- Switch testing framework / or alter setup so that you can run the test with the debug test option rather than play - howerver this will suffice for now
